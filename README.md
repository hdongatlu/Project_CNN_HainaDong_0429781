### Introduction
This project demonstrates the development and training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. CNNs are state-of-the-art models for processing visual data, widely used in various applications such as object recognition, medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles.

### Purpose of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to build an efficient CNN model capable of accurately classifying images into predefined categories. The goal is to explore preprocessing techniques, model architecture, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of images categorized into training and test sets:
- **Training Set**: Augmented with transformations like rescaling, shearing, zooming, and flipping to improve model generalization.
- **Test Set**: Used for evaluating the model's performance. Both datasets were preprocessed with the `ImageDataGenerator` utility from TensorFlow.

Images were resized to 128 * 128 pixels, and binary classification was implemented.

### Machine Learning Model
The CNN architecture involves:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the images.
2. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality while retaining critical features.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform classification tasks.
4. **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting.

Key components:
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for efficient gradient descent.
- **Callbacks**: Early stopping and model checkpoints to monitor and save the best model during training.

### Results
After training for multiple epochs, the model achieved significant accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its ability to classify images effectively. The learning curves (accuracy and loss over epochs) indicate the model's convergence.
